        <h2>Born 1824 in Cazenovia, New York</br>
         Died 1889 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin</h2> 
        <i><p>The following section is derived from the Wisconsin Historical Society biography<sup>1 </sup></p></i>
        <p>Edward Phelps Allis was born May 12, 1824, in Cazenovia, New York. In 1845, Allis graduated from Union College in Schenectady, New York. At the time of his graduation, Allis intended to become a lawyer, but his plans changed and he moved to Milwaukee the following year. Two years after his move to Milwaukee, Allis married Margaret Watson with whom he had 12 children. Allis upon arriving in Wisconsin, started in the leather business. He built extensive tanneries at Two Rivers, Wisconsin. From 1846 to 1854 Allis disposed of his tanneries and transitioned his business operations to banking and real estate.</br> </br> 

        Then in 1860 Allis purchased Milwaukee's Reliance Works where he began producing steam engines and other mill equipment. Additionally, Allis worked on installing a mill to produce iron pipe to supply the water systems in Milwaukee and Chicago, and worked with millwright George Hinckley to develop a high-speed saw for large sawmills. After a mere 20 years in the equipment business, Allis' Company was Milwaukee's largest industrial employer and built heavy machinery for factories, mines, power plants and public utilities. In the 1870s Allis joined the Greenback Party. The Greenback Party was a political movement that gained a more significant following after the severe depression of 1873. Its platform was based on advocating an increase in the supply of paper money -- greenbacks -- first issued by the government to help pay for the Civil War. The Greenback Party believed that maintaining a flexible supply of paper money better served the interests of working people. As a major employer, Edward Allis sought to maintain good relations with his employees and worked to reward the diligence and efficiency of his workers. Allis was the Greenback party's candidate for governor in 1877 and 1881.Â By the time of Allis' death on April 1, 1889, the Allis Company employed more than 1,200 workers and earned over $3 million dollars a year.</br> </br> 

        Edward P. Allis left a legacy as an entrepreneur and manufacturing innovator. He helped to revolutionize steam engines, agricultural equipment and heavy machinery, building a worldwide reputation for his enormous Milwaukee factory. Merging with the Fraser and Chalmers Company in 1901, the Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Company continued to build machinery for most of the 20th century. He was survived by his wife and eleven children. The will of Edward P. Allis issued Margaret Allis (his wife), William W. Allis (son), Edward P. Allis Jr.(son), Charles Allis (son) and Edwin Reynolds (steam engine designer) sole executors of the Allis Company.</p><br>
