         <i><p>The following section is derived from the Columbia University Archives Box 1<sup>1</sup> and Box 328<sup>2</sup> </p></i>

        <p>Edward Allis died in 1889, but the company continued to prosper under the direction of his sons Charles and William. Eight years after the death of their father-- on September 24, 1897-- a telegram sent from E. P. Allis Co. to their New York Representative expresses the company's interest in placing a Memorial to honor the company's founder, Edward P. Allis, in Columbia University. Exactly one week later on October 1, Professor Hutton, SEAS Chair, writes to inform President Seth Low that Mr. W. W. Allis of Milwaukee, Wisconsin has the intention of donating a Steam Engineering Laboratory "with the name of his honored his father, formally of New York." He references a telegram from E. P. Allis Co. saying that it simply stated that "We decided to make the gift." He adds that the value of the proposed Allis Memorial Gift represents a sum more than $15,000. This is approximately half a million dollars in 2018 currency. 

        <p>On October 12, 1897 William W Allis (President of E. P. Allis at the time and son of founder Edward Allis) confirms the telegraph in a letter to SEAS Chair, Prof Hutton. In the letter, William offers Columbia a Reynolds Corliss triple steam engine under the condition of naming the Steam Engineering Laboratory as the "Allis Steam Engineering Laboratory."  </p>

        </div></p>

        <p>On Saturday, October 30 of 1897 Professor Hutton sends an official letter to President Low enclosing a letter from Mr. Wm. W. Allis, President of the Edward P. Allis Company, making the official tender of the memorial equipment in Mechanical Engineering. Professor Hutton states, "He (William Allis) naturally refers in greatest detail to the special product of his company but there is in addition to be a great deal of other equipment which will form the complete whole." On November 12, 1897 President Low writes to Professor Hutton to inform him of the resolutions he plans to submit to the Trustees in reference to the Allis gift. 

        <p>Professor Hutton must have worried a great deal about the resolutions his department needed getting passed because on November 15th, 1897 Professor Hutton writes back at length to President Low regarding the resolutions President Low proposed. It is important to note that this correspondence was occurring during the Panic of 1893. The Panic of 1893 was "a serious economic depression in the United States that began in 1893 and ended in 1897." <sup>3</sup> Professor Hutton tries to convey greater urgency with his requests stating, "in recognition of the insistent financial demands upon the Trustees [I] propose that the appropriation made for this department... This smaller sum is immediately desirable." This is in reference to instillation budget requests for the Allis Steam Engine gift. 

        <p>Two days before Christmas in 1897, William Allis writes to President Low thanking him for his valued favor in the resolutions adopted by the Trustees of Columbia University accepting his company's proposal to provide equipment for the Engineering Laboratory. He mentions that in his correspondence with Professor Hutton suggested that, they supplement the inscription plate by a portrait medallion in bas-relief or by a bust. Edward responds that "both of these have been made of Mr. Edward P. Allis" and that he "shall be able to have a reproduction made and shall be pleased to have it received and placed as suggested." Roughly two years later, plans for the steam engine installation proceed. On December 19, 1899, President Low authorizes installation charges for proposed Allis steam engine. The Allis steam engine is expected to arrive shortly after the first of 1900. </p>

        </div></p>

        <p>Finally, on March 1, 1901 Columbia receives the bronze bust of Edward Allis around which this project centers! President Low writes a letter to W. W. Allis, thanking him for the bust of the late Mr. Edward P. Allis. He says "It is exceedingly pleasing to the University to have this bust, which will serve, I trust, not only as a reminder of what we owe to the liberality of his sons, but also as an inspiration to many generations of students who will work in the Allis Laboratory, which you have so completely equipped as a memorial of him." Little did William Allis imagine, his father would more than 100 years later would be confused for Ulysses S. Grant and help a class of Art History students at Columbia learn so much about Milwaukee!</p>
